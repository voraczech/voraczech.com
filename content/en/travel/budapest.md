You want to visit Buda. You want to visit Pest. I have a few thoughts from there.

> Context: I visited Budapest in June 2024. First time, four days. I had a friend living there with whom I spend most of the time, she also helped and guided me.

## To do before your trip

The only thing you want to do in advance is to buy a ticket to the Hungarian Parliament Building (link below). It is sold out days in advance. Everything else can be done on spot.

## General

It has Vienna potential but not there yet. It is a bit dirty but that is the charm I liked. Three days are good but four or five are better.

## Places

The city itself is wonderful. There were many "wow" moments, monuments are breathtaking.

There are some cons though. You can see poverty on the streets. Some buildings needs to be refurbished (sometimes it is nice, you can call it hipster). As well as some people.

But in general you do not need to worry, it is pretty safe even for a girl alone. I heard that 8th district can be dangerous but it is not a no-go zone, pay attention there.

## Visit

- Országház (Hungarian Parliament Building)
- Halászbástya + Budavári Palota
  - See both and use legs for transportation
- House of Terror
  - The most recommended, pretty good
- Opera house
- Szent István Bazilika (I was not inside)
- Hősök tere (Heroes' Square)
- Nagycsarnok (Central Market Hall)
- Baths
  - Many people recommend Gellért Thermal Bath Gellért Gyógyfürdő és Uszoda
  - I had no time but you should go there
  - Bring your own towel and slippers (you can buy them there though)
- Boat
  - 10-15 Euros, you can book online, audioguide there is useful
  - Check the floods on Danube.

## People

Many people look like they are from The Mézga Family. Those stereotypes…I am sorry. And yes I am old I remember (the) Smolíkovi.

They usually use _Surname Name_ instead of _Name Surname_. Fact (not fun).

A post about Hungary without politics would not be complete, let's go briefly. I was there right before European Parliament election - so yes, there were many references on him. On both of them.

But more fascinating for me was that I noticed Hungarians did not get over the Treaty of Trianon. It was visible multiple times (in the Parliament building or House of Terror texts). Repeating those territories were theirs is a thing. I was shocked. Because of this, I will reconsider making fun of the Northern Hung..I mean Slovakia. Nevermind.

## Eat

Consider this list also as a "words to know" part in this post.

- Lángos
  - Lángosom is my tip. Order "Budapest" (yes, I tried more). People are kind there.
- Kürtőskalács (aka Trdelník aka Chimney cake)
  - Yes, the "traditional" Czech sweet is from Hungary.
- Salami
  - You can order it on lángos.
- Paprika
  - Bought it as a souvenir for parents at Nagycsarnok. They were disappointed I did not take more.
- Asian food
  - For example Bibimbap Korean Restaurant and many others

## Who wants to be a millionaire?

HUF is a crazy currency. Nomial vaules for ordinary things are in thousands.

- 1 BTC ~ 21M (haha) HUF (which means 1 HUF is less then 5 sats!)
- 1 EUR ~ 400 HUF
- 1 USD ~ 360 HUF
- 1 GEL ~ 130 HUF
- 1 CZK ~ 15.5 HUF

Even in CZK you need to multiply.

And the money itself looks like the money used in _Dostihy a sázky_ (Czechoslovakian version of Monopoly). That does not add much credibility either. But you can pay by card anywhere. I saw the paper money only because I asked my friend to show it to me.

## Transport

Walk as much as you can. Budapest is a walk friendly city. You can buy tickets in advance at the machine.

### Metro

Nice. Especially old line stations, some look like a bathroom. Each metro entrance is for one direction, you need to look. They are not visually disturbing, just stairs with a yellow sign.

### Airport

Use buses. You can take 100E (special pricing applies for this one). At the airport you can pay at the machine (cash and card). In front of the bus they will check and validate your ticket and/or help. Pretty good UX compared to others (I am looking at you, Prague).

## Else

Free walking tour may be a good idea. I have not tried it but it makes sense here.

Flixbus offers two stations - _Népliget aut.áll_ (main) and _Mexikói út_ (the one I used). Mexikói út is just a bus stop with a small Flixbus sticker on it, you can sit in Burger King. If you are unsure/don't care, pick Népliget aut.áll.
