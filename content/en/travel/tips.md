A traveller's handbook of random tips. One of many.

## Check sources

This time I attach posts about travelling into sources which are (a bit) more useful than usually. Check them out.

## Preparation

Every time you travel (weekend trips included) write a list what you take and then review. Next time look at the list, get inspired, add changes, review. Repeat until dead.

Because each occasion is different, write a context. Is is for winter vs summer, weekend vs a month, same country vs abroad, business vs personal…?

Also include a list of useful apps, things you took but are useless with reasoning (next time you will want to take it). And a checklist (visa, passport check, insurance…).

## Baggage

Travel light. You can always buy and/or wash. Having an apartment with a washing machine after a few days is a good idea.

Be USB-C maximalist.

## Take a rest

In 3-4 days you should have a free day for relaxation if you have active timetable. You will enjoy it all more. Travelling is an activity.

## Transportation

Choose your transportation based on your preferences and a culture. Sometimes it is good idea to take a more expensive way because of:

- a view (a tram in the city, a boat in a country…)
- time (train stations are in the city center compared to airports)
- money (night travelling may save you accomodation)
- energy saved (travelling is exhausting, comfort is more important the older you are)

Because of it I like night trains. It is important to note I can sleep well there.

And please don't confuse comfort with luxury. Both sides.

### "Everyday" transportation carry

- ear plugs
- eye mask
- Nivea cream
- Alpha waves (for sleeping) and brown noise (for concentration - reading) downloaded

### Airplane

#### Middle seat takes armrests

An unwritten rule I found in the past. The only privilege a middle seat passanger can have. This rule is handy especially if you are in the middle (pun intended).

#### Last call is not last call (for low-cost airlines)

Not to waste time, some airlines make last call almost immediately after a gate is opened.

#### If you use low-cost airlines, be prepared a bad experience may come

And then abandon the airline. It may be the next flight or the 100th one. It is a risk worth trying until things go wrong. Even paying an additional fee for _anything_ is worth the chance. And possibly money you have saved so far. Move on then.

#### Be acceptably late but still prepared

Airports are a magic place where being (acceptably) late is always better than being on time. It does not matter you drop off your baggage last, it will be on top (better for you). It does not matter you get on the plane last if you are on time. When the first people are in the plane, I go to the toilet. At the end, flight attendants are more benevolent and want you to go through as fast as you can.

#### Use sunscreen protection

You are closer to the Sun, use some skin protection.

### Uber, Bolt etc.

Check which apps are in your destination and install them upfront if possible.

#### Do not cancel your ride if you do not need to

Common practice especially in some countries. You order taxi, app finds a driver, they call you to cancel because they cannot arrive. Don't cancel. Credit system should penalize the driver not you. Cancelling may cause some troubles when ordering next driver.

## Drink

Buy a foldable water bottle. Mine is 0,7l. Refill as much as you can (after security check for example).

For each 2-3 hours of flight you should take 1l of water. Take it as a rule of thumb for any transportation.

Many people justifies drinking alcohol especially while travelling. Travelling itself is exhausting enough, you can have a hangover even without alcohol. If you are afraid of flying, ask your doctor to get some medicaments for a flight. Do you want to make the flight shorter? Take a noise cancelling headphones, sleeping mask and/or red glasses. Travelling is not an excuse for excessive drinking.

If you want to drink, fine. Just don't be _that drunk person_ in the transportation vehicle.

## Eat

If you travel through time zones, schedule your last meal "here" for "there" time zone.

Nuts are great for transportation. They are available everywhere, healthy with a lot of energy in a portable pack.

## Sleep

If you travel east, sleep as much as you can. You are loosing hours while travelling. But try not to sleep when you travel west.

## Travel

Use free walking tour. Of course you tip. Usually you give 10 EUR/USD. Reduce if it is bad or shorter (up to 2 hours), increase if it was exceptional or you feel you should give more.
