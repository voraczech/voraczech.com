A list of handy apps for Georgia. For travellers and locals.

## Calls

- your telcom provider
  - I would recommend Magti as everybody else
  - If you are more than one, consider having another operator since Magti also provides internet for homes (accomodations) and in case of an outage none of their services works
- inexPHONE
  - You can call to Georgia and obtain a Georgian number cheaply
  - I received a call (Georgian number) and it worked

## Scooters

Please use scooters where it is convenient for you and others - such as wide streets near Batumi beach or Vake district in Tbilisi with lines especially for you

- Bird
- JET
- Scroll

## Food and delivery

If you already have those apps, simply change your region to Georgia there. Food delivery apps can also deliver groceries

- Glovo
  - I think it is local
- Bolt Food
- Wolt
- Yandex Go!
  - No personal experience
  - Since Yandex tracks a lot, I would not use it
- McDonald's

## Travel

- TTC
  - Tbilisi public transport app
- Bolt
  - The only taxi app you need in Tbilisi
  - Also recommended for other cities
- Maxim
  - Taxi app, it can be handy in Kutaisi for example
- Yandex
  - If everything else fails (never happened in Georgia)

## Accomodation

- Booking
  - Works well especially outside the city
  - Payments are mostly in cash on site
- Airbnb
  - For cities mostly

## Misc
