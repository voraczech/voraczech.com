List of AI resources - how to compare, what to use, where to learn, and more.

## Benchmarking

I can change this constantly because of the infinite inflow of new and better models. It is better to follow some dedicated and better sources. I find the most useful to look at sites that benchmarks them. They are frequently and well updated. As well as benchmarking, they are also useful for finding out current trends - you only need to follow a basic (predefined) view of currently compared models.

- [Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai/)
  - a thorough comparison of AI models
  - they also compare price to power
  - it is a good idea to browse the entire web for specific categories (e.g. text-to-speech)
- [AI Benchmarking Hub](https://epoch.ai/data/ai-benchmarking-dashboard)
  - another benchmarking
  - I personally don't use it much
- [Chatbot Arena](https://lmarena.ai/)
  - AI quality is evaluated by humans
- [LiveBench](https://livebench.ai)
  - AI model benchmarking
- [SEAL LLM Leaderboards](https://scale.com/leaderboard)
  - Another leaderboard
- [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)
  - Toolkit for local development
