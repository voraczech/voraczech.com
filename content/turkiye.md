- Water is not drinkable (if not mentioned)
- Not many Turkish toilets; at the airport there are present but "normal" ones are there as well
- best eSIM card I found - esim4travel.com
- ATMs - https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Turkey#ATMs
  - Ziraat Bankası is safe choice - always decline DCC (dynamic currency conversion) - decline is on the left
